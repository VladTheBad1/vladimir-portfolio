# 📋 Genesis Franchise Platform - 7-Day MVP PRD
## The REALISTIC AI Business Platform We Can Launch Next Week

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Product Vision
Genesis Franchise Platform enables anyone to launch and operate an AI-powered micro-business in 10 minutes, requiring only 30 minutes of daily management to generate $500-5,000/month in revenue.

### 1.2 What This ACTUALLY Is
- **NOT**: Fully autonomous businesses that run themselves
- **YES**: AI-powered franchise model with 90% automation
- **NOT**: Independent business ownership
- **YES**: Revenue-sharing partnership under Genesis umbrella
- **NOT**: Get rich without working
- **YES**: Legitimate passive income with minimal effort

### 1.3 7-Day MVP Goals
- Launch 5 working micro-businesses
- Generate first $1,000 in combined revenue
- Onboard 10 beta franchisees
- Prove the model works

---

## 2. THE HONEST PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 2.1 What People Think They Want
- "Fully automated business"
- "No work required"
- "Instant wealth"

### 2.2 What People Actually Need
- Side income ($500-5k/month)
- Minimal time investment (30 min/day)
- No technical skills required
- Low risk ($99 to start)
- Proven templates that work

### 2.3 Why Current Solutions Fail
| Solution | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Traditional Business | 60+ hours/week, high risk |
| Freelancing | Trading time for money |
| Dropshipping | Saturated, low margins |
| Crypto/NFTs | Too volatile, too complex |
| Course Selling | Need expertise and audience |

---

## 3. THE REALISTIC SOLUTION

## 6. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 6.1 Tech Stack (What We'll Actually Use)

```yaml
Frontend:
  - Next.js 14 (you already know it)
  - Tailwind CSS (fastest styling)
  - Shadcn/ui (pre-built components)
  
Backend:

  - Edge Functions (serverless)
  
Payments:
  - Stripe Connect (only real option)
  - Weekly payouts
  
AI:
  - OpenAI GPT-4 (not GPT-5, too expensive)
  - Rate limiting to control costs
  
Hosting:
  - Vercel (free tier initially)
  - Cloudflare (DNS and CDN)
```

### 6.2 Database Schema

```sql
-- Core Tables
CREATE TABLE franchisees (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  business_name TEXT,
  subdomain TEXT UNIQUE,
  template_id TEXT,
  stripe_account_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  franchisee_id UUID REFERENCES franchisees(id),
  email TEXT,
  subscription_status TEXT,
  monthly_price INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  franchisee_id UUID REFERENCES franchisees(id),
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  amount INTEGER,
  genesis_fee INTEGER,
  franchisee_payout INTEGER,
  status TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE ai_operations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  franchisee_id UUID REFERENCES franchisees(id),
  operation_type TEXT,
  input TEXT,
  output TEXT,
  approved BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 6.3 Critical Code Components

```javascript
// Revenue Sharing Logic
async function processPayment(customerId, amount) {
  // Collect payment via Stripe
  const payment = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: amount * 100, // in cents
    currency: 'usd',
    customer: customerId
  });
  
  // Calculate split
  const stripeFee = amount * 0.029 + 0.30;
  const netAmount = amount - stripeFee;
  const genesisFee = netAmount * 0.40;
  const franchiseePayout = netAmount * 0.60;
  
  // Record transaction
  await supabase.from('transactions').insert({
    franchisee_id: franchiseeId,
    customer_id: customerId,
    amount: amount,
    genesis_fee: genesisFee,
    franchisee_payout: franchiseePayout,
    status: 'completed'
  });
  
  // Schedule payout (weekly batch)
  await schedulePayout(franchiseeId, franchiseePayout);
}

// AI Content Generation with Approval
async function generateContent(franchiseeId, contentType, params) {
  // Generate via GPT-4
  const content = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: "gpt-4",
    prompt: buildPrompt(contentType, params),
    max_tokens: 500 // Control costs
  });
  
  // Store for approval
  const operation = await supabase.from('ai_operations').insert({
    franchisee_id: franchiseeId,
    operation_type: contentType,
    input: JSON.stringify(params),
    output: content.choices[0].text,
