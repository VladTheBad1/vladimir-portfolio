# Concept: VP Global Accelerator Network

## Overview
A hybrid accelerator-community model that provides both early-stage acceleration and ongoing network access. Members graduate through tiers from emerging founder to established operator to investor, creating a complete ecosystem for entrepreneurial growth.

## Target Users
- Primary: Pre-seed to Series B founders (global, English-speaking)
- Secondary: Angel investors and former founders seeking deal flow

## Core Features
1. **Tiered Membership Structure** - Emerging ($2K/yr), Growth ($8K/yr), Elite ($20K/yr)
2. **90-Day Acceleration Cohorts** - Intensive programs with VP mentorship
3. **Global Chapter Network** - 20+ cities with local events and co-working
4. **Alumni Investment Fund** - Members invest in newer cohort companies
5. **Masterclass Library** - VP and guest expert content library
6. **Peer Learning Pods** - Small groups of 6-8 founders for ongoing support

## Technical Approach
- Frontend: React Native app + web portal for global accessibility
- Backend: Scalable cloud architecture (AWS/Vercel)
- Database: Multi-tenant PostgreSQL with geographic data partitioning
- Integrations: Zoom, Slack, Airtable for cohort management, Stripe for payments

## Feasibility Analysis
- Technical Complexity: High
- Market Opportunity: Large (global startup ecosystem)
- Time to MVP: 12 weeks
- Success Probability: 65%
- Required Team: 5 developers + 2 community managers + 1 content creator

## Pros
✅ Scalable model with clear growth path
✅ Multiple revenue streams (memberships, cohorts, success fees)
✅ Global reach maximizes addressable market
✅ Tiered structure captures value at all founder stages
✅ Alumni network creates self-reinforcing community

## Cons
⚠️ High complexity in managing global operations
⚠️ Requires significant upfront content and curriculum development
⚠️ VP time commitment across multiple cohorts
⚠️ Competition with established accelerators (Techstars, Y Combinator)
⚠️ Currency and legal complexities across regions

## Why This Could Work
Combines the proven accelerator model with ongoing community value. VP's expertise in scaling businesses provides unique curriculum and mentorship that competitors can't replicate.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Week 1-3: Build core platform and payment system
2. Week 4-6: Develop curriculum and content library
3. Week 7-9: Launch pilot cohort with 10 founders
4. Week 10-12: Expand to 3 geographic regions simultaneously

## Revenue Model
- **Emerging Tier**: $2,000/year (unlimited members)
- **Growth Tier**: $8,000/year (limited to 500 members)
- **Elite Tier**: $20,000/year (limited to 100 members)
- **Accelerator Cohorts**: $15,000 per founder (4 cohorts/year)
- **Success Fee**: 2% equity in accelerated companies
- **Projected Annual Revenue**: $12M (at full capacity)
