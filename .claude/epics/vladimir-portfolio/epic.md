# Epic: Vladimir Portfolio - Serial Innovator Command Center

## Overview

Build a sophisticated Next.js 14 platform that showcases Vladimir Proskurov's multi-venture portfolio and AI-powered company creation methodology. The platform will serve as an executive-level demonstration of systematic entrepreneurship, featuring interactive venture dashboards, AI creation tools, and global market intelligence visualization.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system for rapid development
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for venture data and user management
- **Hosting:** Vercel for edge deployment and global CDN
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for venture creation demonstrations

### Design Patterns
- **Component Architecture:** Atomic design with reusable components
- **State Management:** React Context for global state, local state for components
- **Data Fetching:** Server Components with streaming for optimal UX
- **Caching:** ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for portfolio data
- **Security:** Row-level security in Supabase, API route protection

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core UI Systems:**
- Responsive navigation with persona-based routing
- Interactive venture portfolio grid with filtering/sorting
- Data visualization components (charts, maps, timelines)
- Video player with custom controls
- Form system with validation
- Modal/dialog system for deep-dives

**Key Interactive Features:**
- AI venture generator with real-time feedback
- Global map with clickable regions
- Venture health dashboard with live metrics
- ROI calculator with dynamic inputs
- Meeting scheduler integration

### Backend Services

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/ventures` - Portfolio data management
- `/api/ai-generator` - AI venture creation proxy
- `/api/analytics` - Custom event tracking
- `/api/contact` - Form submissions
- `/api/scheduler` - Meeting booking

**Data Models:**
```typescript
Venture {
  id, name, category, stage, metrics, 
  description, founded, teamSize
}

Visitor {
  id, type, interests, engagement,
  firstVisit, lastVisit
}

Inquiry {
  id, type, venture, message,
  contactInfo, priority
}
```

### Infrastructure

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Vercel production deployment with preview branches
- Environment variables for API keys
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automated testing before deploy

**Performance Optimization:**
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Edge caching for global performance
- Database connection pooling

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint 1)**
- Project setup with Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- Design system and component library
- Basic routing and navigation
- Venture portfolio data structure

**Phase 2: Core Features (Sprint 2)**
- Venture portfolio dashboard
- AI venture creation demo
- Global market intelligence map
- Basic investor portal

**Phase 3: Engagement (Sprint 3)**

- Launch preparation

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Rate Limits:** Implement caching and queuing
- **Data Sensitivity:** Sanitize all venture metrics
- **Browser Compatibility:** Progressive enhancement approach
- **Content Delays:** Use placeholder content initially

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- E2E testing for critical user journeys
- Performance testing with Lighthouse
- Security scanning with automated tools
