# PRD: Vladimir Proskurov Serial Innovator Command Center

## Executive Summary

The Serial Innovator Command Center is a sophisticated digital platform that positions Vladimir Proskurov as a pioneering serial entrepreneur who systematically creates, launches, and scales multiple ventures simultaneously through AI-powered innovation and global market expertise. The platform serves as both a portfolio showcase and an interactive demonstration of "company a day" capabilities, targeting venture capital partners, potential co-founders, and strategic corporate partners.
